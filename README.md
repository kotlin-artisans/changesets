## How to use

To use this plugin in your project, you must first include the required repositories to pull the
plugin (`settings.gradle)`:

```groovy
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
        mavenLocal()
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

Local and Jitpack repositories are optional, include them if you want to build from source (local) and snapshot
versions (Jitpack).

After that, include the plugin in your root `build.gradle`:

```groovy
plugins {
    id("changesets") version "0.0.1"
}
```

If all goes well, you can start using the tasks available in `changesets` group:

```
./gradlew tasks

...
